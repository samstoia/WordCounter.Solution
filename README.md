# The Word Counter Project

This is a basic console program in C# that allows users to input a sentence and then check to see how many times a particular word was used in that sentence.

## Specifications

Below is a sample of behaviors of the program.

* Program Prompt : Enter a Sentence.
* Sample Input: The Cat is Black.
* Sample Output: Now enter a word to see how many times it appears in that sentence.
* Sample Input: cat
* Sample Output: The word cat appears 1 time(s) in the sentence. Would you like to test another sentence? (Y/N).
* Sample Input: *blank*
* Sample Output: Sorry, that can't be tested *Program restarts*

## Setup and Use

In order to use the program...

* Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/samstoia/WordCounter.Solution) and use the [clone https link](https://github.com/samstoia/WordCounter.Solution.git) to clone or download the files.
* Open the WordCounter.Solution folder, then navigate to the WordCounter folder. Open the Program.exe file in that folder. OR open your console, navigate to WordCounter.Solution/WordCounter and type "mono Program.exe".
* Once open, you will be prompted to enter a sentence, and then a word to count.  If your input is empty, you will get an error message and the program will restart.  You will also have the option to check another sentence once a successful test has been completed.
* If you'd like to exit program after checking a sentence, type "N" and then enter when prompted.
